# gatsby-starter-blog
Gatsby starter for creating a blog

Install this starter (assuming Gatsby is installed) by running from your CLI:
`gatsby new gatsby-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog`

## Running in development
`gatsby develop`

## Creating a new post with a date
`yarn new-post` will prompt for a post title and tags. It generates a new
`index.md` markdown file with the title, tags and date in the frontmatter, in a
folder that follows the format of `src/pages/YYYYMMDD-title-hyphenated/`.
